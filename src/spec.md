# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the “Target Size” tab in Image Resize mode visually distinct via background color styling, especially when active, without changing resize functionality.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Image Resize mode tab styling so the “Target Size” tab uses a different background color than “By Pixels” and “By Percentage” (at minimum for the active/selected state).
- Keep tab labels exactly: “By Pixels”, “By Percentage”, and “Target Size”.
- Ensure only UI styling changes are made; resize behavior, validation, and defaults remain unchanged.

**User-visible outcome:** In the Image Resize options, selecting “Target Size” shows a clearly different tab background color style compared to the other two modes, while the resize features work exactly as before.
