  "summary": "The diff implements comprehensive Word to PDF conversion logic with validation, error handling, retry functionality, and download support. However, the backend conversion returns void and throws an error indicating the service is unavailable, meaning actual PDF conversion is not functional. All frontend requirements appear implemented, but REQ-1's core conversion logic cannot succeed due to the backend limitation.",

      "reason": "The backend conversion call returns void and throws an error stating 'The backend needs to return the PDF bytes'. The conversion logic is structurally present but cannot produce actual PDF output.",
