  "summary": "The diff does not provide evidence that the \"Target Size\" Image Resize tab received distinct background styling (especially for the active state). Two additional files were modified (frontend-file-summaries.txt and project_state.json) without any corresponding request in the BuildRequest.",
  "missing_requirements": [

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Update the Image Resize mode tabs so that the \"Target Size\" tab uses a different background color styling than the \"By Pixels\" and \"By Percentage\" tabs (especially for the active state), while keeping the tab labels as \"By Pixels\", \"By Percentage\", and \"Target Size\".",
      "reason": "The provided diff snippet for ImageResizeOptions.tsx is truncated before any Tabs/TabsTrigger rendering, and the visible portion shows no tab-specific className/style changes. Therefore there is no evidence that the Target Size tab styling was updated as requested.",

      "description": "Updated frontend file summaries metadata content (including mention of removing pdfMake initialization in App.tsx and various unrelated feature descriptions).",
