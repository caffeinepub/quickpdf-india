  "summary": "The diff shows implementation of REQ-3 (Navbar logo update) and REQ-4 (favicon HTML references), but provides no evidence that REQ-1 and REQ-2 (logo and favicon image generation) were completed. The code references image paths that should exist but the diff shows no added image files.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Generate a modern, clean logo image for 'The Bharat PDF' with green as the primary color, white/light background support, minimal SaaS style, incorporating a simple PDF/document/file icon element, using a smooth modern font with flat design (no heavy gradients), optimized for header display at desktop and mobile sizes",
      "reason": "The diff shows no added files. The Navbar component references '/assets/generated/logo-header.dim_400x80.png' but this image file does not appear in the ADDED FILES section. Without evidence of the actual logo image creation, this requirement cannot be verified as complete.",

      "requirement": "Generate a favicon version of The Bharat PDF logo optimized for small sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48 pixels) with the same green theme and recognizable PDF/document icon element",
      "reason": "The diff shows no added files. The index.html references '/assets/generated/favicon.dim_48x48.png' but this image file does not appear in the ADDED FILES section. Without evidence of the actual favicon image creation, this requirement cannot be verified as complete.",
